# PAN_Verification_Project
The PAN (Permanent Account Number) card is a crucial identification document in India used for financial transactions and tax purposes. Creating a verification system can help authenticate PAN card details provided by individuals or entities.

# PAN Card Verification System

This Python-based PAN card verification system allows users to input PAN card details and verifies their authenticity based on predefined validation rules.

## Overview

The PAN Card Verification System provides a simple command-line interface to input PAN card details (PAN number, name, date of birth) and performs verification based on internal logic. It includes modules for user input, verification logic, error handling, and, optionally, API integration.

### Modules:

- `main.py`: Entry point for the system, orchestrating the verification process.
- `user_input.py`: Handles user input for PAN card details.
- `verification_logic.py`: Contains functions for PAN card verification.
- `error_handling.py`: Provides error handling functions for the system.
- `api_integration.py` (Optional): Module for interfacing with external APIs.
- `encryption.py` (Optional): Contains utility functions for data encryption.
- `test_verification.py` (Optional): Unit tests for the verification logic.

## Usage

### Setup:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Install required dependencies (if any) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Running the System:

Run the system by executing `python main.py` in the terminal. Follow the prompts to input PAN card details for verification.

## Notes

- This system is for demonstration purposes and might lack full-fledged verification against official databases.
- Security and privacy considerations should be taken into account when handling sensitive PAN card information.
- For API integration, replace placeholders with actual API endpoints and ensure compliance with API documentation.
